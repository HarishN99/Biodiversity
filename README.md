This page intends to help vizualize bacterial data for each volunter, identifying the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons such that if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a canditate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will then be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel. 

Components of the page include:

- Horizontal Bar Chart
- Bubble Chart
- Gauge Chart
